Link to Report Rough Draft: https://tigermailauburn-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/dab0103_auburn_edu/EewzwlfkhbNIqEY8vUeKrIgBPPZcwjESGOLX1Yi5hkJeDA?e=gcfUd8
The above link should let anyone edit the report. After editing please create a PDF of it and re-upload to this repo. 

Remaining actions?:
* Add additional complexity to pre-commit hook. Right now it just runs bandit with basically same flags as workshop 4
* Add additional / more complicated fuzzing functions to fuzz.py. Verify it still runs as part of GitHub Actions
* Add additional logging statements throughout the SLI-KUBE source files and verify it doesn't overwhelm the output .log file.
* Any additional changes need to be added to the report.
* Add lessons learned to report
